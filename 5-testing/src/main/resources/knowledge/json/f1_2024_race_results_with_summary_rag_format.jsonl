Max Verstappen, the defending Drivers' Champion, won seven of the first ten races for Red Bull Racing, but was challenged by McLaren's Lando Norris as the season progressed. Despite the challenge, Verstappen secured his fourth consecutive Drivers' Championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Meanwhile, McLaren overtook Red Bull to win their ninth Constructors' Championship at the final race in Abu Dhabi, their first such title in 26 years. This marked the first Constructors' Championship victory by a team other than Red Bull or Mercedes since 2009. Verstappen also became the first driver since 1983 to win the title while driving for the third-placed constructor."}
